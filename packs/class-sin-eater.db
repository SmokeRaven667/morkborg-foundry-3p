Are they malign being warped by arcane chaos, do they belong to a cursed bloodline, or are they touched by some cruel god? Many believe that their souls are eternally damned as the cost for forgiving those they eat. When a sin-eater dies, their bodies are salted and burned. Their remains are not allowed to be buried in the hallowed ground of most cemeteries.\nThe two-headed basilisks of the one true faith abhor them.
